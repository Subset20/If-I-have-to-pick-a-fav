        <h1>My Lego Creations</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my world of Lego! Here's a glimpse of my childhood creations and the memories they bring.</p>

    <section id="creations">
        <!-- Lego Tank Section -->
        <div class="creation">
            <h2>The Lego Tank</h2>
            <p>This was my first Lego design: a blocky, funny-looking tank with a cannon! It wasn’t perfect, but it was tank-shaped, and to me, that made it powerful. It was a symbol of my imagination and the limitless possibilities that Lego provided me with!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Lego Fighter Jet Section -->
        <div class="creation">
            <h2>The Lego Fighter Jet</h2>
            <p>My Lego fighter jet was flat and missing some features, like the cockpit and wheels, but to me, it was a jet ready for flight. Every piece represented a step in my Lego journey, even if the designs were simple. It reminded me that creativity is about vision, not perfection.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Lego Viking Ship Section -->
        <div class="creation">
            <h2>The Lego Viking Ship</h2>
            <img src="images/Viking-ship.jpg" alt="Lego Viking Ship" class="creation-img">
            <p>This is my new Lego creation: a Viking ship, where brave sailors set out to explore new lands. It’s my next step in the Lego journey, inspired by the adventures I used to imagine as a child. Every Lego piece I add to this ship brings it closer to becoming a reality—just like the visions I had with my tank and jet!</p>
